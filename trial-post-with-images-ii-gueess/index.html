Be prepared to wait till 3:30 in line to get tickets, then from 4:30 to 5:15, and then sitting for about ~40 minutes waiting for the show to start. I'm a big fan of Noah, so I didn't regret the experience. My sister whined a bit. She's never seen a full TDS episode before.</p><p>Tickets are free on the website, but that's just a pre-reservation, you will need to get in line and get the real tickets on the day of.</p><p>After I got the tickets online, the website said tickets would be distributed at the location around 3:30. (It may say 2:30 or some other time for you), but you should ideally get in line around 1 PM or earlier. (More on this later). The subway next door was our restroom for the day. I think their business pretty much runs on everyone waiting in line. Fwiw, there's a shop to the left that rents chairs out @ $5 if you can't stand on your own feet.</p><p>Just so you know, I got in line around 1:50 PM and had ticket number 70, I wish I was around ~30, not for better seats to watch the show (I had the center seats on the last row), but so that Trevor or the comic before him would bother interacting with us. This is obviously guest specific, our guest was Rose Byrne. Get here earlier if its someone more famous scheduled. If you look like a senior citizen the guard might bump you up later when you come back at 4:30.</p><p>Around 2:30 one of the security / body guards came and gave us instructions, no alcohol, drugs, pepper spray, weapons etc. Everyone in the party needs ID's to prove they're 18+ and the person who booked the tickets needs to be present. There's a capacity of 200 people. (I think) They give out yellow tickets to those who will definitely make it, and blue ones to the losers at the end of the line who are on standby.</p><p>Once the line starts moving, you will get tickets around 3:30 - 3:50. They will tell you when to come back, it was 4:30 for us.</p><p>We went to a bar nearby for the nest hour and got some drinks and nachos.</p><p>We got back at 4:30 and there were coops for tickets 1 - 20, 20 - 40, 50 - 65, 65  - 80, and so on. There's no point in coming back earlier than the time they tell you to. Honestly, come back ~10 - 15 mins later if your ticket number is 40+ and you should be fine.</p><p>A body guard will come back and let you use the rest room before coming back to the same spot. You can't run to the rest room between entering the studio and leaving it, so it was "recommended you use it". You're also told to not take photos during the show taping, or while walking to your seats. Same body guard bumped up the older couple in our coop and got them in first. They were in the first row.</p><p>Once you're back to your spot in the coops / line, they will let you in after about 10 mins, where you go through a security check and then enter the studio.</p><p>An usher will instruct you to which seat to sit in. Once you're sitting, you can take photos without standing. Music will fade in and out giving you the show is about to start. I'd recommend carrying a book to read or something so you don't get bored / fall asleep.</p><p>Someone (For us it was this girl: https://goo.gl/maps/ub3j4NVed2v ) will show up instructing you on how the show will proceed and the rules. She was pretty funny about it, so I didn't mind it at all.</p><p>After another boring long wait, a standup comic will come and talk to the audience, and pump you up for the laughing / cheering / clapping. This is where it helps to have lower tickets, if you were hoping to interact (with the standup or Trevor).</p><p>He introduces Trevor in about 10 minutes. Trevor takes a few ( 3 - 4 ) quick questions, nothing serious. Someone asked him a FMK between Jeb Bush, Drumpf and Cruz, another asked him to sing him happy birthday.</p><p>After this the show starts, you have a good laugh, and then leave (you get to use the restroom one last time).</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">I Am Surya</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
